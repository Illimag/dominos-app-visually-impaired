## Context

### Prototype

This Web Application Prototype built in Angular 8 is based on the Personas Limitation Spectrum from the Inclusive Design Methodology.

### Example of a Live Use Case

According to the document 

	20190613153319483_DominosPetition.pdf 

located in this repository, in the case between Domino's Pizza LLC vs Guillermo Robles states the question:

	Whether Title III of the ADA requires a website
	or mobile phone application that offers goods or services
	to the public to satisfy discrete accessibility requirements
	with respect to individuals with disabilities?

### Hypothesis Driven Design

The following are hypotheses, experiments, and evidence according to the hypothesis driven design process. 

Hypothesis: Increasing the size of the elements of the Dominos Application will increase usability and visability.

Experiment: Testing this application on individuals with Visual Impairment.

Evidence: The hypothesis is correct when the individuals who normally can not order from Domino's can order using the elements of increased size.

### Design Constraints and Platform Features

The near certain usage of Voice Assistant on Android devices and Vision Accessibility for iOS devices, constrain the design of the application. 

Additionally, design details that are purely aesthetic will be of increased difficulty for Personas Limitation Spectrum with Visual Impairment to see.
