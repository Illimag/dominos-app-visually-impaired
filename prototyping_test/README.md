# Prototyping Test

## Prototyping Test Plan

### Testing Objective

I believe that the Domino's App will increase usability and visability when the elements are increased in size.

### Scope

~Twelve Screens, Minimal functionality. Main focus on user being able to select order.

### Testing Scenario

Easy to see the elements on the screen

### Testing Metrics

X and Y coordinates of user tap interaction and screen transition timings.

### Recruiting Criteria

Personas Spectrum Limitation for the Visually Imparied

### Script

Why? Who? What? Where? When? How?

## Next steps

### Update Design

Targeting the Visually Impaired -> Blind

Focus on Voice Assistant for Andriod.

Vision Accessibility for iOS.

Redesign to allow for both, or if it is easier to just make seperate websites depending on the target device.

User Agents to detect device, and redirect according to user device.

Implement bootstrap for grid and mobile responsive functionality.

Implement material design for design consistency.

### Deployment

Host Web App to Web Server

### Google Analytics

Implement Google Analytics to web app.

### Features
                                                                                                        
Currently, the prototype is built with Angular 8.

- Finish up the components.

- Some kind of json object that saves the choices to the last screen which is the checkout screen.

### On hold 

Just use online web tools for now.

Implement prototype with fullscreen API in the welcome screen to simulate full screen application experience. 
Backend scripts to detect X and Y coordinates of user tap interaction. 
As well as screen transition timings. 
Record into json after checkout button is selected.

## Heatmap / Eyeball Tracking Implementation

Implement a Heatmap / Eyeball tracking functionality on the Angular 8 prototype.
