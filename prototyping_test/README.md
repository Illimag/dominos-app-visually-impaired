# Prototyping Test

## Prototyping Test Plan

### Testing Objective

I believe that the Domino's App will increase usability and visability when the elements are increased in size.

### Scope

~Twelve Screens, Minimal functionality. Main focus on user being able to select order.

### Testing Scenario

Easy to see the elements on the screen

### Testing Metrics

X and Y coordinates of user tap interaction and screen transition timings.

### Recruiting Criteria

Personas Spectrum Limitation for the Visually Imparied

### Script

Why? Who? What? Where? When? How?

## Next steps

Implement prototype with fullscreen API in the welcome screen to simulate full screen application experience. 

Backend scripts to detect X and Y coordinates of user tap interaction. 

As well as screen transition timings. 

Record into json after checkout button is selected.

Currently, the prototype is built with Angular 8.

- Finish up the components.

- Some kind of json object that saves the choices to the last screen which is the checkout screen.

## Additional Steps

Update the designs.

## Heatmap / Eyeball Tracking Implementation

Implement a Heatmap / Eyeball tracking functionality on the Angular 8 prototype.
